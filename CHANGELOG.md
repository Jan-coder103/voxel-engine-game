# Changelog

All notable changes to MICRO//WORLD are documented here.
Format loosely follows Keep a Changelog; versioning is informal until
the first external release.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-08 — Phase 0 + Phase 1 (First Pixel)

### Added

- Tooling: TypeScript (strict), Vite, Vitest (node env), ESLint flat
  config, Prettier, CI workflow (lint → typecheck → test → build,
  Node 22).
- World state: `VoxelVolume` dense cubic storage (`Uint16Array`,
  bounds-checked), negative-safe world/chunk/local coordinate
  conversions, material IDs (air = 0), demo world generator.
- Meshing: naive culled face mesher producing plain typed arrays;
  BufferGeometry builder with per-vertex colors + `materialId`
  attribute; renderer bootstrap (scene, camera, lights, resize, loop).
- Player: pointer-lock mouse look, WASD + jump, gravity, per-axis AABB
  voxel collision at fixed 60 Hz timestep, void respawn.
- Tests: 38 unit tests across coordinates, storage, mesher (incl.
  winding verification), controller. Mesher benchmarks with recorded
  baselines in `docs/performance.md`.
- Docs: README, architecture, performance, known issues, progress
  tracker.
